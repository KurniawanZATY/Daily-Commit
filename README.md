# Daily-Commit
GitHub Commit Auto Green Workflow Action

One day, I was looking at my GitHub profile and seethe contribution metrics and wondering

"dammmmmn, I want a contribution with full labels for the entire year!"

ok it's because I see a funny website called [GitHub Worth](https://github-worth.vercel.app/), I think fully commit to GitHub by daily basis will significantly boost this fiction price.

Then I start Google the solution, it turns out automating this commits progress use GitHub Action will be the most effective solution.

## How to use this repo

Simply copy this repository, update the git configuration setting in `daily_commit.yml` file. You need to update:
-  `git config --global user.email "huangsunchuangyu@outlook.com"`
-  `git config --global user.name "rNLKJA"`

Change the email and username with your GitHub email and username ðŸ˜„

One more thing, make sure you provide the write permission for GitHub Action so it can commit properly.
